# hydratedPolymer: A Voxel-Based Model of Steric-Confined Water Binding in Polymeric Networks

> _Simulating steric shielding and directional hydration in chitosan films bonded to soft or stiff PDMS substrates._

## üß† Project Overview
HydrationSpace is a Python-based simulation framework that models hydration potential in flexible hydrophilic polymer chains (e.g., chitosan) using a voxelized Gaussian kernel influenced by interfacial steric effects. The model maps 3D hydration fields with respect to:

- Local atomic polarity (NH3+, OH, CH)
- Substrate stiffness (via PDMS modulus in MPa)
- Spatial steric shielding from bonded sites
- Directional confinement effects

The model is grounded in voxel-based distance weighting, Gaussian interaction kernels, and physics-informed scaling (via exponential integrals). Visualization tools render hydration fields alongside molecular structure using RDKit and matplotlib.

## üî¨ Motivation
The hydration state of biopolymer films like chitosan significantly impacts their mechanical, biological, and drug-release performance. However, few models capture how hydration evolves under spatially resolved steric effects from substrate bonding or interfacial stiffness.

HydrationSpace introduces a voxel-based strategy to:
- Simulate and visualize hydration potential in real-space
- Connect substrate stiffness to steric confinement
- Predict water-binding distributions in bonded polymer chains
