# hydratedPolymer: A Voxel-Based Model of Steric-Confined Water Binding in Polymeric Networks

> _Simulating steric shielding and directional hydration in chitosan films bonded to soft or stiff PDMS substrates (Nat. Commun. In Review)._

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
HydratedPolymer is a  simulation framework that models hydration potential in flexible hydrophilic polymer chains (e.g., chitosan) using a voxelized Gaussian kernel influenced by interfacial steric effects. The model maps 3D hydration fields with respect to:

- Local atomic polarity (NH3+, OH, CH)
- Substrate stiffness (via PDMS modulus in MPa)
- Spatial steric shielding from bonded sites
- Directional confinement effects

The model is grounded in voxel-based distance weighting, Gaussian interaction kernels, and physics-informed scaling (via exponential integrals).

## ðŸ”¬ Motivation
Hydro-softening (Nat. Commun., In Review) significantly changes the mechanical and biological responses (Matter, In Review) of polymers. However, few models capture how hydration evolves under spatially resolved steric effects from substrate interfacial stiffness (Driving mechanism of hydro-softening).

HydratedPolymer introduces a voxel-based strategy to:
- Simulate and visualize hydration potential in real-space
- Connect substrate stiffness to steric confinement
- Predict water-binding distributions in bonded polymer chains
