# Hydro-Softening-Simulation

> _Simulating steric shielding and directional hydration in hydro-softened polymeric films (Nat. Commun., In Review)._

## üß† Project Overview

**Hydro-Softening-Simulation** is a voxel-based computational framework designed to simulate hydration behavior in flexible polymer chains under the influence of steric confinement from bonded interfaces, such as soft elastomer substrates. It models local hydration potential based on:

- Atomic polarity from SMILES-derived structures  
- Substrate-induced steric shielding (via bonded hydroxyls)  
- Spatial anisotropy and directional decay  
- Voxel-based hydration fields using Gaussian kernels  
- Mechanical softening effects driven by substrate modulus

This framework enables analysis of water localization, entropic redistribution, and thermodynamic behavior across varied bonding conditions.

## üî¨ Motivation

Hydro-softening describes a condition where polymers become mechanically softer in the presence of soft interfaces, largely due to enhanced hydration under confined geometries. This framework bridges real-space simulation with measurable material behavior, enabling:

- Prediction of hydration trends from interfacial stiffness  
- Visualization of hydration anisotropy and shielding  
- Thermodynamic analysis (T‚ÄìdS cycles, entropy modulation, radial decay)  
- Foundation for material design rules across biointerface systems
