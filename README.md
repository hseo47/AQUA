# ðŸ’§ AQUA Hydration Model ðŸ’§

## Project Motivation and Overview

***Mechanical properties of polymeric materials are determined by the disproportionately small, tightly-bonded water particles*** ðŸ’§ ***near the polymer backbone.*** 

**AQUA** (Adaptive Quantification of Unbound and Affined) Hydration Model is a voxel-based computational framework designed to interpret hydration behavior in polymer chains under the influence of steric confinement from bonded interfaces. It models local hydration potential based on:

- Atomic polarity from chemical structures  
- Substrate-induced steric shielding effects 
- Spatial anisotropy and directional decay  
- Voxel-based hydration fields using Gaussian kernels
