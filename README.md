# üíß AQUA Hydration Model üíß

## Project Motivation and Overview

***Mechanical properties of polymeric materials are determined by the disproportionately small, tightly-bonded water particles*** üíß ***near the polymer backbone.*** 

**AQUA** (Adaptive Quantification of Unbound and Affined) is a voxel-based computational framework designed to interpret hydration behavior in polymer chains under the influence of steric confinement from bonded interfaces. It models local hydration potential based on:

- Atomic polarity from chemical structures  
- Substrate-induced steric shielding effects 
- Spatial anisotropy and directional decay  
- Voxel-based hydration fields using Gaussian kernels  

We have previously demonstrated softening of rigid materials with nanoscale confinement of water.

```bash
python thermAnalysis.py
python thermDiag.py
```

### 6. Post-Processing Scripts
Analyze hydration distribution using the following scripts:
```bash
python entropy.py         # Shannon entropy vs modulus
python anisotropy.py      # Directional hydration decay
python radialDecay.py     # Radial decay from max hydration site
